War/Peace is the profound realization that we have a choice in what we consume and assimilate into our minds and lives. It is a creative and collaborative project which intends to serve as a thoughtful reminder to _slow down _so we can allow meaningful dialogue to emerge about what's happening around us in our communities and abroad.
